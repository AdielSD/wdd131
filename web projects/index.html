            <p>Hi, my name is Sephora Diaz. I’m from Peru and I’m currently studying software development while also exploring creative areas like web design and languages. I enjoy learning new skills that help me grow both personally and professionally,
         and I’m motivated by the question, “What am I capable of?”.
         Outside of school and work, I love dancing, riding motorcycles, and discovering new ways to challenge myself.
         This page is part of my journey to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I continue building a strong foundation in web development.</p>

                Peru is located on the western coast of South America and was once the center of the powerful Inca Empire. It is home to Machu Picchu, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, and has a rich mix of ancient traditions and modern culture.

The country is also known for its breathtaking landscapes, from the Andes mountains to the Amazon rainforest.

Fun Facts:

Peru is the birthplace of the potato, with over 3,000 varieties.

The Nazca Lines, massive geoglyphs carved into the desert, can only be fully seen from the air and remain a mystery today.
